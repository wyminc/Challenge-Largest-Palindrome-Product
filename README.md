Largest Palindrome Product
===========
A palindromic number reads the same both ways.

The **first argument and only argument** sets the requirement for the **total digits** in a factor.

    10 is a two-digit number
    1996 is a four-digit number

## Advanced

Write a test for finding the largest palindrome product of 4 digits, and another test for 5 digits.

Make the tests pass and push to your `advanced` branch.

---

There are **2** tests initially, make the tests pass.

1. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of 2 two-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
1. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of 2 three-digit numbers. Write two tests that check the return object for the correct factor values.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. To retrieve all dependecies, run the command: `npm install`
3. Your work will be done in the file named: `largest_palindrome_product.js`
4. Run your test with the command: `npm test`
5. There are two tests total. Make them pass!

When you are done, push your answer to the `master` branch, and checkout `advanced` branch and read the Advanced portion of the readme.
